HealthLamp Air is a hardware IoT project based on the ESP8266 microchip. It's designed to measure, record and visualize the quality of air in your house in real time.

# Design & development

The main idea of this device is to be a minimalistic stylish part of your house design while offering a full range of modern air quality control capabilities.

I decided to use natural material and developed the special conical design which provide unique embedded lightning air quality visualization and great airflow.

Project development included the following parts:
1. Product design and idea development
2. Hardware prototype development and components selection
2. Software prototype development
3. Body molding and internal components printing
4. Prototype assembly and testing

## Product design development (Autodesk Fusion 360 / 3ds Max):
